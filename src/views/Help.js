              <p className="card-text">
                To check if an SNP exists at position 92311 on 5, first, select 5 from the chromosome
                dropdown, then put 92311 into both start and end. The server will return all variants that
                have a presence at this position. In most cases, it would be an SNP, sometimes it would be short indels.

                To get a list of variants at this range, please select MT from the Chromosome dropdown, put 54000 as the start, and
                54900 as the end. The server will return a list of variants in this range.

              <p className="card-text">
                Currently, you are only allowed to search for up to 5,000 bps at a time.

                When I search with a range with start of 5000 and end of 5500, what variants will get returned?
              </b>
              <p className="card-text">
                The server will search for the range you provide, and any variants that have presence at any one nucleotide
                within your search range will get returned.

                Yes, you may click on the Download button, located at the top right corner of the table.
